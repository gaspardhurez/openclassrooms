### Goals

The goal of this project is to identify relevant variables that could come into play
for a data auto-completion application required by Sant√© Publique France.

### Data overview

The data is the Open Food Facts dataset. It's a quite large dataset with more than 160 variables;

Only relevant variables to the goal of this project were kept.

As I chose to focus on the Nutri-score related data, I reduced the dataset scope to 22 variables:

- General qualitative product information:
	Product name
	Brand
	Country of origin
	Product category
	Product main category

- Nutritional quantitative information:
	Nutritional values per 100g for variables with less than 80% missing values

-  Nutri-score


### Cleaning treatments

The following data quality shortfalls have been identified during the inspection phase.

1. 
Shortfall : Creation date as a string Unix timestamp
Treatment : Remove value errors then convert to datetime

2.
Shortfall : 6000 full duplicates
Treatment : Remove them

3. 
Shortfall : 45000 duplicates for product name & brand combination (some products have different nutritional values over time)
Treatment : Keep only the most recent value

4. 
Shortfall : 73% missing values for categories_fr
Treatment : Remove variable

5.
Shortfall : 73% missing values in main_category_fr
Treatment : Remove variable

6. 
Shortfall : 722 unique values in countries_fr
Treatment : Remove inconsistent typos (multiple countries, non-latin characters, only 1,5% of the dataset)

7.
Shortfall : 1000 Anormal outlier values for nutritional values
Treatment : Remove out of bounds values

8.
Shortfall : 20 to 40% missing values on all nutritional values
Treatment : Impute values with KNNImputer


9.
Shortfall : 99% missing values on fruits-vegetables-nuts_100g
Treatment : Deduct missing values from Nutriscore formula and other nutritional values


10.
Shortfall : 31% missing values on nutriscore
Treatment : Compute new nutriscore variable with clean values
